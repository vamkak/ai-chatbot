# Explain a stage file

1. If the learner did not name a file, ask which stage they are on and name the file from the
   stage table in AGENTS.md.
2. Read the file. Start with its header comment: say in two sentences what this stage adds
   and why.
3. Walk the code in the order it runs. For each line that carries the stage's idea, give
   one bullet that starts with the line itself in backticks, then one plain sentence on
   what the line does and why it is there. A block of a few lines that does one thing, such
   as the call that creates the client, gets one bullet with its first line and the line
   numbers of the block. A single line with several parts, such as a dictionary with two
   keys or a call with three arguments, gets one bullet per part, each starting with that
   part in backticks, for example `"role": "system"` and then `"content"`. Group the
   bullets under the script's numbered labels. Skip lines the learner already knows from
   earlier stages, such as the client lines after stage 1 and the system entry after
   stage 2, unless they ask. The one-line-of-code limit from the course rules does not
   apply here; the six-bullet limit does not apply either, but every bullet still holds one
   line and one sentence.
4. Point out the lines marked `NEW in stage N`: these are the only lines that changed from
   the previous stage. Where a line is shaped for reading rather than for the computer, say
   so in one sentence, for example that the quoted pieces inside the parentheses of the
   system entry join into one string and are split across lines only so that the code is
   easier to read.
5. Close with two sentences before the question: one that says in everyday language what
   the block means, for example "Here are the café's facts and rules, and here is the
   question to answer", and one that says what the block does not do yet, for example that
   it only builds the list and does not send it to the model.
6. End with one optional question that checks understanding, such as which line the model
   receives its input from, what the list holds after label 2, or what would happen if one
   of the new lines were removed. If the learner asks a question instead of answering,
   answer it, and do not ask the same checking question again.

Do not paste the whole file back. Do not write new code. Define every technical term the
first time it appears, using the course's own words: system entry, user entry, the list,
the reply, the tokens number, KEEP, the route, the caller. Quote every value from the file
as it is written there; never invent an example value, because the learner will look for it
in the file. If the learner asks what a Python word or line means, answer it directly.
